A practical repository documenting my journey in algorithmic trading using Python and real-world APIs.


# 🧠 Trading Geeks – Python for Algorithmic Trading

Welcome to my personal repository where I document my journey in algorithmic trading using Python. This repo showcases practical scripts, strategies, and tools I’m building and learning along the way.

## 🚀 Vision

To build robust trading tools, analyze financial data, and automate strategies using real-world trading APIs — while leveling up my Python and quantitative finance skills.

## 📂 Repository Structure

This is how the project is organized:

- `api_scripts/` – Scripts to connect and fetch data from exchanges (e.g., Wootrade)
- `data_analysis/` – Volume analysis, PnL calculations, and trade insights
- `strategies/` – Backtestable or live-ready trading strategies
- `utils/` – Helper modules (logging, config, error handling)
- `README.md` – This file
